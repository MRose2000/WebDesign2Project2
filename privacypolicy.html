        At Nintendo, we know your privacy is very important to you, so please
        take the time to carefully read our privacy policy. Our policy is
        designed to help you understand the types of information that we
        collect, how we use and share the information and how the information is
        protected. This privacy policy applies to all Nintendo services that
        directly reference or link to this policy, but does not apply to
        Nintendo services that have separate privacy policies that do not
        incorporate this policy.
        <h3 class="priv-header">1. Categories of information we collect</h3>
        <li class="priv-subheader">Information that you give to us</li>
        <p class="priv-content-bullet">When you register for and use our services we collect the information
        that you give to us. This may include information like your name, email
        address, phone number, date of birth, country of residence, language,
        gender, and time zone.</p>
        <li class="priv-subheader">Information about your device</li>
        <p class="priv-content-bullet">When you use our services we may collect specific information about your

        number, operating system, device settings, device performance, device
        and advertising identifiers, Internet service provider, IP address and
        other unique personal or online identifiers. If you or your device
        experiences an error, we collect information about the error, the time
        the error occurred, the application or features being used, the state of
        the application when the error occurred, and any communications or
        content provided at the time the error occurred.</p>
        <li class="priv-subheader">Information about your use of our services</li>
        <p class="priv-content-bullet">We collect information about your use of and interaction with our
        services. This could include information about your gameplay, your
        online status, your service use history, your connections and
        interactions with other users, the content you share, the date and time
        of your visit, information about the links you click, pages you view,

        to create a profile about preferences and characteristics, standard
        server log information, and other information about how you use our
        services.</p>
        <li class="priv-subheader">Your content</li>
        <p class="priv-content-bullet">Our services may allow you to create, upload or share content such as
        text, images, audio, video, your nickname and user icon, or other
        content that you create or is licensed to you. When you use any of our
        services that include these or other similar capabilities we may
        collect your content in accordance with our user agreements or terms
        of use and this policy. </p>
        <li class="priv-subheader">Your purchases</li>
        <p class="priv-content-bullet">Some of our services allow you
        to make purchases. If you use any of our services to make a purchase,
        we may collect information about the purchase. This could include
        payment information, such as your credit card number, account
        authentication information, and contact information like your billing
        and shipping address. </p>
        <li class="priv-subheader">Location information</li> 
        <p class="priv-content-bullet">With your consent, we may
        collect and process information about your precise location. When we
        have your location information, we use it to tailor our services for
        you and others, like helping you establish friend relationships with
        other Nintendo users. </p>
        <li class="priv-subheader">Information from other sources</li>
        <p class="priv-content-bullet">We may also
        receive information about you from other sources, including from users
        of our services, entities that sell information, and third-party
        services and organizations. For example, if you access any social
        media or similar services through our services to login or to share
        information about your experience on our services with others, we may
        collect information from these third-party services.</p> 
        <li class="priv-subheader">Aggregated and deidentified information</li>
        <p class="priv-content-bullet">We may aggregate or de-identify the
        information described above. Aggregated or de-identified information
        is not subject to this policy. </p>
        <h3 class="priv-header">2. How we use your information</h3>
        <p class="priv-content">We use the information that you give us and the information we collect to
        deliver, maintain and improve our services, including for the

        parties. However, we do permit third-party service providers to
        collect personal information, as described here, through some of our
        services and we share personal information with third party service
        providers for business purposes as described in this policy, including
        but not limited to providing advertising on our services and elsewhere
        based on users’ online activities over time and across different
        sites, services, and devices. </p>

        <p class="priv-content-bullet">We may share some or all of the categories of your personal information, as identified above, with
        third-party service providers that provide services to us for a
        variety of business purposes, such as payment processing, customer

        <p class="priv-content-bullet">If you access third-party services -- such as third-party online gaming

        of our services, in accordance with their own privacy policies. </p>
        <li class="priv-subheader">With your consent</li>
        <p class="priv-content">We may share information for any other purposes disclosed
        to you at the time we collect the information or pursuant to your

        <h3 class="priv-header">4. Your controls, choices and rights</h3>
        <p class="priv-content">We may offer you certain
        controls and choices regarding the information we collect, how the
        information is used, and how it is shared. These controls and choices

        available to you. </p>
        <h3 class="priv-header">5. Information retention and information security</h3>
        <p class="priv-content">Personal information will be retained only for so long as reasonably
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, in
        accordance with applicable laws. We have implemented administrative,
        physical and technical security measures that are designed to protect
        your information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access,
        disclosure, alteration and destruction. You should understand though
        that, despite our efforts, no security can be guaranteed as
        impenetrable. Please note that information collected by third parties
        may not have the same security protections as information you submit
        to us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such
        information. </p>
        <h3 class="priv-header">6. Information about children</h3>
        <p class="priv-content">We do not knowingly collect,
        use or share personal information from children under the age of 13
        without verifiable parental consent or as permitted by law. Where a
        parent or legal guardian has provided consent, the child may be able
        to use his or her Nintendo Account to play certain third-party games
        and applications that are not published by Nintendo. Parents or
        guardians may review, modify, or delete the child’s personal
        information, or withdraw consent, by contacting us using the contact
        information provided at the end of this privacy policy, and may manage
        which third-party games and applications can access and use the
        child’s Nintendo Account information through your Nintendo Account
        profile settings. </p>
        <h3 class="priv-header">7. Changes</h3>
        <p class="priv-content">Nintendo may update this privacy policy from
        time to time. When we update it, we will revise the "Last Updated"
        date above. If we make material changes in the way we collect, use,
        retain or share your personal information, we will notify you by
        sending you an email at the last email address that you provided us,
        or by posting notice of the changes on the services covered by this
        privacy policy.</p>
